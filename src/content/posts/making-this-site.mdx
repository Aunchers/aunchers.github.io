I struggled with making this site. not from
the designing or programming, that only took some 3 days,  
but with the actually completing it. I'll prob make a blog  
post in the coming days, or weeks, describing the process of me  
creating -> trashing -> creating projects.  
This is moreso a post for me to talk about the past 3 days of designing  
and publishing this site in a technical aspect.  
as you'll proabably see, I'm pretty bad at web design, and writing  
but just bare with me here. There will be a lot of rambling.

## humble beginnings

I had a whole lot of inspiration that fueled this project, from [notnite](https://notnite.com), and [kyun](https://kyun.host).  
You can proabably see more notnine like layout as that was my "template" while designing.  
I had a thought of maybe using a fancy design system that could swap out different layouts of my site,  
aka "infinite" designs. but that's a lot of CSS, and my design had me using non-tailwind css. at this point tailwind  
is in my blood.  
Anyways, I initially wanted to be info heavy, to avoid making multiple pages.  
My old figma design shows that, but eventually (While making the site), i found out that I enjoyed the minimalness of less. (also less coding lol)  
I ended up going with something somewhat too much like notnite. but ehh, its "inspiration" lmao.

## everything else

I kinda lost motivation writing this, it took 2 weeks to actually make this website due to procrastination and blog being painful to create. (WTF astro).

so idk.
see ya next time.
