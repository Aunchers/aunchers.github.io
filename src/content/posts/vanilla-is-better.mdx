## INTRO
This is weird. I have always fawned over new tech. Whether it being Zed, or Arc browser. I just love new stuff.
I distro-hop (will talk another time), I language-hop, way too much. Always chasing the pretty new thing.
It was different with web based stuff. I found Next.JS, I stuck with it. I played around with other stuff, but Next had me. Hook-Line and sinekr.
And to be honest, Next fucking sucked.
I recommended it so much. And I've never enjoyed making things with it. The most make I've done is v0 (AI) which has sucked every living feeling out of my
bones. So, the other day, I decided to start a new project. It was called RedditToMarkdown. For speed I did it in Vanilla HTML, for the first time in forever.
And I LOVED it

## Continuance
I don't know what it is, but writing Vanilla JS inspires me. CSS (albeit tailwind/src) is faar better than prebuilt shit. Idk
rediscoverance (not a word lol) I guess. While continuing this journey, I'll periodically update this page linking new vanilla
projects and their data in this format
PROJ_NAME (day, month year)
HTMX seems interesting, so anything thats basically vanilla will be listed here, with +HTMX or whatev added.
