A while back a friend was talking about their favourite character in a show, 
Their birthday was coming up, so I thought cool, I can make stuff, I can make their present(gift).
My thought, was I could make something like [portalgraph](https://portalgraph.io) (something I saw a while back). 
The idea is to have a 3d illusion of a 3d character in real life by slapping a bunch of screens to a box.
Somehting like this
<video controls width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: "12px" }}>
  <source src="https://www.portalgraph.com/videos/Portalgraph%203%20screen%20type.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

*yes this 3 laptop screen, i digress*

I was planning to make a smaller, compact version, with 3.2 screens. 
One problem: I've never touched hardware before

## The beginning

My first idea was to use godot on a [RP4](), why an RP4 and not a RP5? because I was just gifted that, and I'm broke af. 
Problems with godot? it can't really run 3d on a RP4, so I was left pondering. and pondering. 
Till Ithought, what if I just make the "3d" part myself. I could prob learn graphics programming (:skull:) and then make a 3 camera system, connect each camera to a screen, and beautiful "3d".
So I began my journey of finding the perfect language for this. and my big beautiful brain decided ofc, the best language, RUST (oh my sweet summer self).
